# Long Reads Workshop, Zurich 2017

This is a place of development of materials for the long read workshop organised by Patricia Palagi within Training mission of [Swiss Instidute of Bioinformatics](https://www.sib.swiss/training).
This is the second time we organise the workshop, the materials of the last year can be found [here](https://github.com/aechchiki/SIB_LRW_Bern16).

#### Development of materials

- The text of the practicals will be in the [wiki of this repository](https://github.com/aechchiki/SIB_LongReadsWorkshop_Zurich17/wiki). This organization will allow to move details to separated cross-linked pages and to keep the main page of practicals clear and non-polluted by details.
- This repository should serve mainly for testing, but also for the record of downloaded data, all the scripts, etc.
- You can add here figures (preferably `png` format) that can be linked from wiki, also some SMALL datasets
- You should NOT add here bigger data, pdfs, or other stuff that is not very useful to version
- Do not hesitate to use issues
